# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This is a single-maintainer pre-1.0 FOSS package. Security fixes land on the
**latest tagged release**, best-effort. Older tags are not backported. If you
need stronger guarantees than that, please vendor the code or sponsor the
project.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue or pull request for suspected
vulnerabilities.

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

> <https://github.com/Vusys/tetryon/security/advisories/new>

That route notifies the maintainer privately, opens an embargoed advisory, and
gives us a place to coordinate the fix and CVE if needed.

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, email `bryan@vuii.co.uk`.

## What to include

- Affected version(s) / git SHA.
- A minimal reproduction (OS, Firefox version, and a failing test where
  possible).
- Expected vs. actual behaviour, and the security impact you observed.

## What to expect

Best-effort response and triage. No SLA, no bug bounty — this is unfunded hobby
work. If a report is confirmed, the fix will ship in the next tagged release and
we'll publish an advisory crediting the reporter (unless they prefer to remain
anonymous).

## Scope

In-scope:

- Anything in `src/` — the runtime library code.
- The browser launch path and temporary-profile handling.
- Anything in `.github/` that could leak secrets or grant unintended write
  access.

Out-of-scope:

- Firefox itself and the WebDriver BiDi protocol — report those to Mozilla.
- Composer dependencies — please report those upstream.
- The application under test — Tetryon drives the browser; it does not vouch for
  the site you point it at.
